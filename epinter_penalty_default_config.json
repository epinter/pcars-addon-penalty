// Penalty Addon for Project Cars Dedicated Server
// 
// This addon monitors players impact and gives penalty points to them. When the users reach an Warning level,
// the server sends a message through chat. The player is kicked when he reaches the Kick level. Each lap a player
// completes a lap without crash, the penalty points are decreased. The same happens when the player crosses the line in P1.
